The \\nincidence of PDAC is increasing. Currently available cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease \\nare modestly effective. For all patients, multidisciplinary management, comprehensive germline \\ntesting, and integrated supportive care are recommended.\\nApproximately 60 430 new diagnoses of pancreatic cancer are anticipated in the US in \\n2021.1 The incidence is rising at a rate of 0.5% to 1.0% per year, and pancreatic cancer \\nis projected to become the second-leading cause of cancer death by 2030 in the US.1,2 \\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for the majority (90%)of pancreatic \\nneoplasms, and the other subtypes include acinar carcinoma, pancreaticoblastoma, and \\nneuroendocrine tumors. Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with nonspecific \\nsymptoms at an advanced stage with disease that is not amenable to curative surgery.1 \\nNo effective screening exists. The 5-year survival rate approached 10% for the first time in \\n2020, compared with 5.26% in 2000.1 The survival improvements have been modest and \\nattributed primarily to multiagent cytotoxic therapies.3–5 Recently, comprehensive germline \\nand somatic genomic sequencing became standard of care for small subgroups of patients \\nwith targeted treatment opportunities.6,7 Olaparib, a poly (adenosine diphosphate[ADB]-\\nribose) polymerase inhibitor, can prolong cancer control in patients with a BRCA1/2 \\npathogenic germline variant.8,9 This review summarizes current evidence regarding \\npathobiology, diagnosis, and management of PDAC.\\nMethods\\nA PubMed search was performed for English-language articles describing randomized \\nclinical trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews of pancreatic cancer published between \\nJanuary 1, 2010, and July 5, 2021.

    "#  Document(metadata={'source': './documents/nihms-1828057.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Epidemiology and Screening\\nPDAC is the third-leading cause of cancer mortality in the US and the seventh-leading cause \\nworldwide (Box).10The median age at diagnosis in the US is 71 years, and PDAC is slightly \\nmore common in men than in women (5.5 vs 4.0 per 100 000 individuals).11At presentation, \\n50% of patients have metastatic disease, 10% to 15% have localized disease amenable to \\nsurgery, and the remainder (30%–35%) have locally advanced mostly unresectable disease \\ndue to the extent of tumor-vascular involvement.1 Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms \\n(PanINs) refer to precancerous lesions, of which a small fraction may progress to high-grade \\ndysplasia and PDAC.12 Low-grade PanINs are common and their potential to transform \\ninto a malignancy is unclear. In a retrospective review of 584 patients who underwent a \\npancreatectomy for non-PDAC (median age, 59 years), 153 patients (26%) were identified \\nwith PanINs; most patients had low-grade PanIN-1 (50%) or PanIN-2 (41%) and 13 (8%) \\nhad PanIN-3. None of the patients with PanIN-3 developed cancer, whereas 1 patient with \\nPanIN-1B developed cancer in 4.4 years.13 Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are \\nmore common precancerous cystic lesions than PanINs and can arise in either the main \\nor branch pancreatic duct. In a cohort study of 605 patients who underwent a surgical \\nprocedure for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, the malignancy rate for final \\npathology in main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms was 68%, whereas in \\na different cohort study of 1404 patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous \\nneoplasms, only 15% evolved to PDAC over 15 years.14–16 Annual imaging surveillance \\nis recommended; however, there is no consensus as to the optimal surveillance method or \\nfrequency of assessment.15,17 For asymptomatic average-risk individuals, the US Preventive \\nServices Task Force recommends against routine screening for PDAC.18\\nModifiable and Inherited Risk Factors\\nAmong lifestyle risk factors, current cigarette smoking has the strongest association \\nwith PDAC. A meta-analysis of 12 case-control studies that included 6507 patients with \\npancreatic cancer and 12 890 control patients reported an odds ratio (OR) of 1.74 (95% CI, \\n1.61–1.87) for the association of current smoking with pancreatic cancer (absolute rates not \\nreported).19,20 There was also a modest association of alcohol use with PDAC, when intake \\nexceeded 30 g per day (approximately 3 drinks per day), according to a meta-analysis of 19 \\nprospective studies reporting outcomes from 4 211 129 individuals (relative risk, 1.22 [95% \\nCI, 1.03–1.45]; absolute rates not reported).21 Chronic pancreatitis was associated with a \\n13-fold increased risk for PDAC in a pooled analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies of \\n862 664 individuals (relative risk, 13.3 [95% CI, 6.1–28.9]).22 Obesity, defined as a body \\nmass index in the fifth quintile (highest 20%), was also associated with an increased risk \\nof PDAC (incidence, 14.1 vs 5.7 per 100 000 person-years; adjusted relative risk, 1.54 \\n[95% CI, 1.04–2.29]) in a Norwegian analysis of 940 060 individuals.23 Diets of processed \\nmeat, high-fructose beverages, and saturated fat were associated with obesity, diabetes, and \\npancreatic cancer.24 The incidence of PDAC in people younger than 30 years is increasing. \\nThe annual incidence of PDAC increased with younger age from 1995 to 2014, from 0.77% \\n(95% CI, 0.57%–0.98%) for those aged 45 to 49 years, to 2.47% (95% CI, 1.77%–3.18%) \\nfor those aged 30 to 34 years, to 4.34% (95% CI, 3.19%–5.50%) for those aged 25 to 29 \\nyears, consistent with an increase in younger patients.24 This observation may be related Park et al.
